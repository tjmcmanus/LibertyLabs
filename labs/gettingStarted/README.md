This is the gettingStarted directory where you have the following labs
  -  The [setup lab](./0_setup/setup.md  "Set up the labs") runs through all of the basic set up of the infrastructure that you will need to execute the labs successfully.  It should take about 10 minutes to get through.

  -  The [discover lab](./1_discover/discover.md  "Set up the labs") runs you through the basics of WebSphere Liberty and WebSphere Developer Tools.   This lab will take about 20 minutes to get through.
