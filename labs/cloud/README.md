# Cloud labs

Here is a list of the current labs around Cloud.

* The [Using Liberty on IBM Cloud](./1_LibertyOnIBMCloud/DiscoverLibertyonBluemix.md) lab shows the user how to run an application up on IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry.   This lab uses command line tools and WebSphere Developer Tools.

* [Introduction to Docker](./4_HelloDocker/HelloDocker.md) is a lab that show you the basics of running Docker, packaging an application and runtime, then executing the container.

* [Liberty From Bare Metal to the IBM Container Service](./6_ScalingContainers/scalingContainers.md) is a lab where you will run the the application locally against a database in the cloud. Package the application into a docker container and execute locally.  Next you will push this to IBM Container Service, then scale up the containers or instances of the application.  All togethers executing against the same database in the cloud.

* [Exposing REST API using the API Discover feature](./2_APIDiscovery/APIDiscovery.Lab.md)
