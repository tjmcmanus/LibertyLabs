Liberty Discovery Project

Congratulations on picking up the Discovery Archive for IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty and associated developer tools.

Liberty is lightweight, yet robust, simple to use, yet powerful application server for increased productivity in a DevOps environment. It is both developer friendly and production ready for web, OSGi, mobile, tradition applications, microservice or firmware for a "Thing".  Extremely fast coupled with small footprint and ease of use makes Liberty a great option for building any application. Whether your solution requires full Java EE or just a simple composible microservice.

This Discovery Archive contains everything you need to get a development environment up and running on Liberty quickly and easily. It also contains information on how to set up a production environment.

The Discovery Archive contains a set of presentations to help you understand and position the Liberty technology, use the tools to develop an application, extend the runtime with a Liberty feature, expand to the cloud, and deploy to a collective for administration.   The presentations are in the  presentations directory.

The Discovery Archive contains a set of labs to help you get started to discover, develop, manage and expand to the cloud. For the cloud labs you may need to login into Bluemix.net. This would require a Bluemix account.

   1. Start with the setup and discover lab under the [labs/gettingStarted ](./labs/gettingStarted/README.md  "labs/gettingStarted ") directory.
   1. Work on any of the development labs under the [labs/development ](./labs/development/README.md   "labs/development ") directory.
   1. Work on cloud related labs under the [labs/cloud ](./labs/cloud/README.md   "labs/cloud ")  directory.
   1. Work on administration related labs under the [labs/management ](./labs/management/README.md   "labs/management ") directory.

In additions, there is a [video ](./LibertyIntro.mp4   "lvideo") and a set of redbooks in the redbooks directory.

For those of you developing applications for the z/OS environment, rest assured that the Liberty capabilities included in the Discovery Archive are also applicable to z/OS. Furthermore, the Liberty included with WebSphere Application Server for z/OS adds optional features for tight integration with z/OS workload management, transactions, and security. Download the latest Beta for z/os from https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-beta/.  A trial of the Liberty for use in the z/OS environment is available.
